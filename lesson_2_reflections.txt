Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
It sets up all the secret files in the background
that prepare Git to track your repository.

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Answer:
I wouldn't think it gives much value, except for
the fact that you can see what you have staged
in "Status" before you actually "commit" - and that
could be really useful, to be able to tell exactly
what will happen when you hit that button. 
But I wonder how you remove a file?
Looks like removing a file is trivial with the GUI.
Superuser.com says you can "--amend" maybe.
It seems rather complicated.
Oh it says:
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
